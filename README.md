# User-Log
This project was created as practice on how lists worked and the multiple functions that they have.

## What does it do?
This project simulates a fixed log with space for 10 items, in this case names.
This program can perform multiple actions with its contents, including:
  - Adding a new name into the log at the biggest index available
  - Deleting a name from the log, freeing up space for the next
    name added
  - Finding a specific name on the log, regardless of capitalization, so long as
    the name is added exactly like its log counterpart
  - Printing out the complete contents of the list, including names and empty
    spaces in the list.

The log will start with no pre-determined name, and all of the names will be deleted whenever the
program is terminated.
